# To Do App

### Project Overview
This project is all about practicing key skills including the use of classes, file handling, and user interaction in a console application. Since it runs in the console, it might be a bit tricky if you’re not familiar with tech stuff. But, I’ll be improving it soon to make it easier for everyone to use.

### How to Use
When you run the program, you’ll see a menu with these options:

- Add Item
-  View Items
- Mark Item Complete
- Save Data
- Load Data
- Exit

If you’re using this app for the first time, you won’t have any items on your To-Do list yet. Start by choosing `Add Item` The program will ask for the title and description of your task. Add all the tasks you need to get done and make sure to save your data by choosing `Save Data` so you don’t lose it.

You can also use the `View Items` and `Mark Item Complete` options to tackle your list. Just check the order of your tasks from View Items before marking them as complete.

**DON'T FORGET**: If you add new tasks without loading the old ones by using `Load Data`, you’ll lose those previous tasks. So always load your old tasks first before adding new ones.

### Conclusion
This project is a great starting point for anyone learning C# or programming in general. Building and using simple projects like this can help reinforce the concepts you've learned. Thanks for checking it out!
